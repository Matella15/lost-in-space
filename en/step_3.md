## Step 1: Animating a spaceship

Let's make a spaceship that flies towards the Earth!

+ Open a new empty Scratch project.

+ Add 'Spaceship' and 'Earth' sprites to your stage.

+ Add the 'Stars' backdrop to your stage.

+ Click on your new spaceship sprite, and click the 'Costumes' tab.

+ Use the arrow tool to select the image. Then click on the circular rotate handle, and rotate the image until it is on its side.

+ Add this code to your spaceship sprite:

    Change the numbers in the code blocks, so that the code is exactly the same as in the image above.

    Test and save: If you click the green flag you should see the spaceship speak, turn, and glide towards the centre of the stage.

## Challenge: Improving your animation
Can you change the numbers in your animation code, so that:

+ The spaceship moves until it touches the Earth?
+ The spaceship moves more slowly towards the Earth?

You'll need to change the numbers in this block:
